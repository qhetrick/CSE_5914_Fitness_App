# CSE 5914 Fitness App
Our team is committed to creating an app that saves you from guessing your workouts.  By using Elasticsearch to query a plethora of sources for exercises sorted by muscle group and individual muscle, we can create a streamlined training experience that will increase efficient progress in our users.

# Identifying the Problem

The best way to produce viable output through our code is to first understand our problem space. We've decided to start with some basic questions in an attempt to break down our problem.

<ol>
    Who is our user base? <br>
    What constitues an effective work out? <br>
    What sources will we pull from using Elasticsearch? <br>
</ol>

Once setup is completed add your name HERE: <br>
