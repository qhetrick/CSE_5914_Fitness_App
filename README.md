# CSE 5914 Fitness App
Our team is committed to creating an app that saves you from guessing your workouts.  By using Elasticsearch to query a plethora of sources for exercises sorted by muscle group and individual muscle, we can create a streamlined training experience that will increase efficient progress in our users.

    What sources will we pull from using Elasticsearch? <br>
