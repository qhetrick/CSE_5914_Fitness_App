# Identifying the Problem

The best way to produce viable output through our code is to first understand our problem space. We've decided to start with some basic questions in an attempt to break down our problem.

<ol>
    Who is our user base? <br>
    What constitues an effective work out? <br>
    What sources will we pull from using Elasticsearch? <br>
</ol>
